/**
 * The contended resource (Pillar B): finite seats for a product (a train departure).
 *
 * `available` is NEVER updated through the entity state — that would be a lost-update
 * waiting to happen. All decrements/restocks go through the atomic conditional UPDATEs
 * in [InventoryItemRepository], which is what makes "never oversell" hold under
 * concurrency. The PostgreSQL schema adds a CHECK (available >= 0) as a last line of
 * defence (see db/migration/V1__baseline.sql).
