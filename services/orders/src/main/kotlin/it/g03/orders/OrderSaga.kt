/**
 * THE ORCHESTRATED SAGA (design decision #3): Orders is the coordinator; the stages are driven by Kafka (order-placed triggers this handler) but each decision is taken via a SYNCHRONOUS call ("a decision must be made now")!
 *
 * Crash/redelivery semantics (at-least-once, chaos #2/#4):
 * - this method deliberately holds NO database transaction across remote calls; each transition commits separately via [OrderStateMachine]
 * - every downstream operation is idempotent (Inventory/Payments replay stored outcomes), so re-running the saga after a crash resumes from where it left off: PENDING → re-runs everything; RESERVED/PAYMENT_PENDING → skip reserve; terminal → no-op
 *
 * Resilience (Pillar C, Phase 2): the Payments call is wrapped in a circuit breaker (see [HttpPaymentsGateway]). A transport fault no longer THROWS out of the saga — it returns "UNAVAILABLE", which PARKS the order in PAYMENT_PENDING for [OrderRecoverySweeper] to retry. A lost optimistic-lock race on a concurrent terminal transition (two sweeper pods, or sweep + redelivery) surfaces as [ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException] and is absorbed here as a benign no-op (the other driver already advanced the order)
