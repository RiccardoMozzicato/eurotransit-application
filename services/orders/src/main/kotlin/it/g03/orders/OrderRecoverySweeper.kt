/**
 * Re-drives the orders PARKED in PAYMENT_PENDING by the circuit-breaker fallback (see [OrderSaga] stage 2). The Kafka
 * listener already committed its offset when it parked the order, so there is NO redelivery to lean on: this sweep is
 * what turns PAYMENT_PENDING from a dead-end into a recoverable state. Once Payments is reachable again the breaker
 * moves OPEN -> HALF_OPEN, a retried authorize succeeds, and [OrderSaga] advances the order to CONFIRMED
 *
 * Money-safety (Pillar B/C): an order parked LONGER than the inventory hold TTL has had its seats restocked by
 * Inventory's reconciler, so re-authorizing it would CHARGE the card and then fail confirm (EXPIRED) with no refund
 * until #4. Such orders are rejected (RESERVATION_EXPIRED) WITHOUT re-authorizing. `app.recovery.max-park` MUST be
 * <= the inventory hold TTL for this to hold. This also caps the otherwise-unbounded retry of a wedged order
 *
 * Async lifecycle (same shape as Inventory's ReservationReconciler):
 * - SupervisorJob scope: one failed sweep never stops the loop;
 * - per-order isolation: one failing order (e.g. the loser of a multi-pod @Version race) does not skip the rest;
 * - cooperative shutdown: on SIGTERM Spring calls [destroy], scope.cancel() ends the loop at the next delay. An
 *   iteration already in flight finishes its blocking gateway calls (not joined); since every transition commits
 *   independently and is idempotent/resumable, an abandoned iteration is safely resumed on restart;
 * - runs on Dispatchers.IO because [OrderSaga.handle] does BLOCKING work (HTTP gateway calls + JPA). This deliberately
 *   diverges from the older ReservationReconciler/OutboxPublisher (which use Dispatchers.Default): blocking I/O belongs
 *   on the elastic IO pool, not the CPU-bound Default pool (deck 06 blocking-vs-suspending / Kotlin dispatcher guidance).
 *
 * Gated by app.recovery.enabled so tests (which steer the fake gateways directly) keep the background loop OFF
