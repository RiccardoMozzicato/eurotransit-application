/**
 * Single place where the Resilience4j policies are composed for an outbound gateway call (Pillar C, Fase 2 §2).
 * Both [HttpPaymentsGateway] and [HttpInventoryGateway] route their HTTP calls through here so the composition
 * ORDER is defined exactly once (DRY) and cannot drift between gateways.
 *
 * Composition (the canonical Resilience4j order, deck 11 / plan §2.5):
 *
 *     Retry( CircuitBreaker( Bulkhead( call ) ) )
 *
 * Retry is OUTERMOST, Bulkhead INNERMOST — achieved by applying `.withBulkhead` first and `.withRetry` last
 * (each `.withX` wraps the previous). Consequences (all intended, documented in docs/design.md decision 7):
 *  - Breaker OPEN -> the inner call throws `CallNotPermittedException`; it is NOT in the retry's retry-exceptions,
 *    so the retry does not loop on it -> fast-fail, no retry storm (slide 45).
 *  - Bulkhead full -> `BulkheadFullException`; also not retried, and added to the breaker's ignore-exceptions so a
 *    local concurrency cap does not by itself open the breaker (genuine slowness is already caught by the >2s
 *    slow-call rate).
 *  - Retry outermost => every attempt is a data point for the breaker, so it opens faster under a sustained fault.
 *
 * Applied PROGRAMMATICALLY via the injected registries (NOT the `@Retry`/`@Bulkhead` annotations): same rationale as
 * the §1 breaker — the resilience4j-spring-boot3 starter's AOP aspect is not guaranteed to weave on Spring Boot 4
 * (docs/agent-log.md #2), whereas the registry beans are verified to bind (OrdersApplicationTests), so the
 * decoration is deterministic.
