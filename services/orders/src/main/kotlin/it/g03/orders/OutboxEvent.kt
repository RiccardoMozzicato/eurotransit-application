/**
 * The TRANSACTIONAL OUTBOX (design decision #4) — the fix for the dual-write problem.
 *
 * Writing to the database AND publishing to Kafka are two different systems: a crash in
 * between either loses the event or creates a ghost. So the event is written HERE, in the
 * SAME transaction as the business change (order row); a separate relay
 * ([OutboxPublisher]) reads unpublished rows and publishes them, marking publishedAt.
 * Guarantee: at-least-once → consumers must be idempotent (they are, by design).
